This specification defines a number of improvements to the tooling API.

# Use cases

## Tooling can be developed for Gradle plugins

Many plugins have a model of some kind that declares something about the project. In order to build tooling for these
plugins, such as IDE integration, it is necessary to make these models available outside the build process.

This must be done in a way such that the tooling and the build logic can be versioned separately, and that a given
version of the tooling can work with more than one version of the build logic, and vice versa.

## Replace or override the built-in Gradle IDE plugins

The Gradle IDE plugins currently implement a certain mapping from a Gradle model to a particular IDE model. It should be
possible for a plugin to completely replace the built-in plugins and assemble their own mapping to the IDE model.

Note that this is not the same thing as making the IDE plugins more flexible (although there is a good case to be made there
too). It is about allowing a completely different implementation of the Java domain - such as the Android plugins - to provide
their own opinion of how the project should be represented in the IDE.

## Built-in Gradle plugins should be less priviledged

Currently, the built-in Gradle plugins are priviledged in several ways, such that only built-in plugins can use
certain features. One such feature is exposing their models to tooling. The IDE and build comparison models
are baked into the tooling API. This means that these plugins, and only these plugins, can contribute models to tooling.

This hard-coding has a number of downsides beyond the obvious lack of flexibility:

* Causes awkward cycles in the Gradle source tree.
* Responsibilities live in the wrong projects, so that, for example, the IDE project knows how to assemble the
  build comparison project. This means that the IDE plugin must be available for the tooling API provider to work.
* Cannot replace the implementation of a model, as discussed above.
* A tooling model cannot be 'private' to a plugin. For example, the build comparison model is really a private cross-version
  model that allows different versions of the build comparison plugin to communicate with each other.
* A tooling model must be distributed as part of the core Gradle runtime. This makes it difficult to bust up the
  Gradle distribution.

Over time, we want to make the built-in plugins less priviledged so that the difference between a 'built-in' plugin and
a 'custom' is gradually reduced. Allowing custom plugins to contribute tooling models and changing the build-in plugins
to use this same mechanism is one step in this direction.

# Implementation plan

## Story: Expose the build script of a project

This story exposes via the tooling API some basic information about the build script of a project.

1. Add a `GradleScript` type with the following properties:
    1. A `file` property with type `File`.
2. Add a `buildScript` property to `GradleProject` with type `GradleScript`.
3. Include an `@since` javadoc tag and an `@Incubating` annotation on the new types and methods.
4. Change `GradleProjectBuilder` to populate the model.

An example usage:

    GradleProject project = connection.getModel(GradleProject.class);
    System.out.println("project " + project.getPath() + " uses script " + project.getBuildScript().getFile());

### Test coverage

- Add a new `ToolingApiSpecification` integration test class that covers:
    - A project with standard build script location
    - A project with customized build script location
- Verify that a decent error message is received when using a Gradle version that does not expose the build scripts.
    - Request `GradleProject` directly.
    - Using `GradleProject` via an `EclipseProject` or `IdeaModule`.

## Story: Expose the compile details of a build script

This story exposes some information about how a build script will be compiled. This information can be used by an
IDE to provide some basic content assistance for a build script.

1. Introduce a new hierachy to represent a classpath element. Retrofit the IDEA and Eclipse models to use this.
    - Should expose a set of files, a set of source archives and a set of API docs.
2. Add `compileClasspath` property to `GradleScript` to expose the build script classpath.
3. Include the Gradle API and core plugins in the script classpath.
    - Should include the source and Javadoc
4. Add a `groovyVersion` property to `GradleScript` to expose the Groovy version that is used.

### Open issues

- Need to flesh out the classpath types.
- Will need to use Eclipse and IDEA specific classpath models

### Test coverage

- Add a new `ToolingApiSpecification` integration test class that covers:
    - Gradle API is included in the classpath.
    - buildSrc output is included in the classpath, if present.
    - Classpath declared in script is included in the classpath.
    - Classpath declared in script of ancestor project is included in the classpath.
    - Source and Javadoc artifacts for the above are included in the classpath.
- Verify that a decent error message is received when using a Gradle version that does not expose the build script classpath.

## Story: Expose the publications of a project

This story allows an IDE to map dependencies between different Gradle builds and and between Gradle and non-Gradle builds.
For incoming dependencies, the Gradle coordinates of a given library are already exposed through `ExternalDependency`. This
story exposes the outgoing publications of a Gradle project.

1. Add a `GradlePublication` type with the following properties:
    1. An `id` property with type `GradleModuleVersion`.
2. Add a `publications` property to `GradleProject` with type `DomainObjectSet<GradlePublication>`.
3. Include an `@since` javadoc tag and an `@Incubating` annotation on the new types and methods.
4. Introduce a project-scoped internal service which provides some detail about the publications of a project:
    1. The `publishing` plugin registers each publication defined in the `publishing.publications` container.
       For an instance of type `IvyPublicationInternal`, use the publication's `identity` property to determine the publication identifier to use.
       For an instance of type `MavenPublicationInternal`, use the publication's `mavenProjectIdentity` property.
    2. For each `MavenResolver` defined for the `uploadArchives` task, register a publication. Use the resolver's `pom` property to determine the
       publication identifier to use. Will need to deal with duplicate values.
    3. When the `uploadArchives` task has any other type of repository defined, then register a publication that uses the `uploadArchives.configuration.module`
       property to determine the publication identifier to use.
5. Change `GradleProjectBuilder` to use this service to populate the tooling model.

An example usage:

    GradleProject project = connection.getModel(GradleProject.class);
    for (GradlePublication publication: project.getPublications()) {
        System.out.println("project " + project.getPath() + " produces " + publication.getId());
    }

### Test coverage

- Add a new `ToolingApiSpecification` integration test class that covers:
    - For a project that does not configure `uploadArchives` or use the publishing plugins, verify that the tooling model does not include any publications.
    - A project that uses the `ivy-publish` plugin and defines a single Ivy publication.
    - A project that uses the `maven-publish` plugin and defines a single Maven publication.
    - A project that uses the `maven` plugin and defines a single remote `mavenDeployer` repository on the `uploadArchives` task.
    - A project that defines a single Ivy repository on the `uploadArchives` task.
- Verify that a decent error message is received when using a Gradle version that does not expose the publications.

## Story: Gradle plugin provides a custom tooling model to the tooling API client

This story allows a custom plugin to expose a tooling model to any tooling API client that shares compatible model classes.

1. Add a public API to allow a plugin to register a tooling model to make available to the tooling API clients.
2. Move core tooling model implementations to live with their plugin implementations.
3. Custom plugin classpath travels with serialized model object back to the provider.

### Test cases

- Client requests a tooling model provided by a custom plugin.
- Client receives a reasonable error message when:
    - Target Gradle version does not support custom tooling models. Should receive an `UnknownModelException`
    - No plugin in the target build provides the requested model. Should receive an `UnknownModelException`.
    - Failure occurs when the plugin attempts to build the requested model.
    - Failure to serialize or deserialize the requested model.
- Generalise `UnsupportedModelFeedbackCrossVersionSpec`.
- Plugin attempts to register a model that some other plugin already has registered.

## Story: Tooling API client builds a complex tooling model in a single operation

This story adds support for a tooling API to query portions of the Gradle model in an efficient way.

Introduce the concept of a `BuildAction`. A build action is provided by the tooling API client and is serialized across to the process where
the build is running. It can then query the models as required and return a result. This result is serialized back to the tooling API client.

This approach allows the action to make decisions about which models to request and to request multiple models efficiently within a single
build invocation. It can also later provide the action with access to features which cannot be serialized to the tooling API client.

    public interface BuildAction<T> extends Serializable {
        T execute(BuildController controller);
    }

    public interface BuildController {
        <T> T getModel(Class<T> modelType);
        // Later stories will add more here
    }

    public interface BuildActionExecutor<T> extends LongRunningOperation {
        T get();
        void get(ResultHandler<? super T> handler);
    }

    <T> ConsumerActionExecutor<T> execute(ConsumerAction<T> action);

The `BuildController` interface provides a single method `getModel()` which returns the tooling model of the given type for the default project
associated with the `ProjectConnection`. This method will return the same result as `ProjectConnect.getModel()` would.

For this story, the build action is executed before the build has been configured. If any model is requested, the build is fully configured. Later stories
will introduce a more efficient implementation, where the work done by the build is driven on demand by what the action asks for, and some caching of
models is used.

### Test cases

- Action builds a result and this result is received by the client.
    - Returns a custom result type
    - Returns a custom result type that references a built-in tooling model
    - Returns a custom result type that references multiple tooling models
    - Returns a custom result type that references a custom tooling model whose implementation uses classes that conflict with the client
    - Client changes action implementation to return a different result
- Verify environment that the action executes in:
    - Logging is received by the client as part of the build output.
    - Context ClassLoader is set appropriately.
    - No Gradle-version specific classes are visible to the action.
- Client receives a reasonable error message when:
    - Target Gradle version does not support consumer actions.
    - The action throws an exception.
    - A failure occurs configuring the build.
    - The action cannot be serialized or deserialized.
    - The action result cannot be serialized or deserialized.
    - The Gradle process is killed before the action completes.
    - The action requests an unknown model.
    - The action is compiled for Java 6 but the build runs with Java 5.

## Story: Tooling API build action iterates over the projects of build

Extend `BuildController` to add methods to query which projects are included in the build, and to request a model from a given project.

## Story: Expose the IDE output directories

Add the appropriate properties to the IDEA and Eclipse models.

## Story: Expose the project root directory

Add a `projectDir` property to `GradleProject`

### Test coverage

- Verify that a decent error message is received when using a Gradle version that does not expose the project directory

## Story: Expose the Java language level

Split out a `GradleJavaProject` model from `GradleProject` and expose this for Java projects.

Add the appropriate properties to the IDEA, Eclipse and GradleJavaProject models. For Eclipse, need to expose the appropriate
container and nature. For IDEA, need to choose between setting level on all modules vs setting level on project and inheriting.

## Story: Expose the Groovy language level

Split out a `GradleGroovyProject` model from `GradleProject` and expose this for Groovy projects.

Add the appropriate properties to the IDEA, Eclipse and GradleGroovyProject models.

## Story: Expose generated directories

It is useful for IDEs to know which directories are generated by the build. An initial approximation can be to expose
just the build directory and the `.gradle` directory. This can be improved later.

## Story: Tooling API client cancels a long running operation

- Fetching a model
- Running tasks
- Running a custom action

## Story: Add a convenience dependency for obtaining the tooling API JARs

Similar to `gradleApi()`

## Story: Add ability to launch tests in debug mode

Need to allow a debug port to be specified, as hard-coded port 5005 can conflict with IDEA.

# Open issues

* Discovery or registration?
* Per-build or per-project?
* Replace `LongRunningOperation.standardOutput` and `standardError` with overloads that take a `Writer`, and (later) deprecate the `OutputStream` variants.
